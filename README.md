### Week 4 Activity 1
Created a Playlists detail screen and added state and reducer functionality, I also implemented async storage and tested by closing the app and reopening them. When I reopened the app, the songs are still there. 

| Add Playlists with Swipe for Delete | Adding Songs, Undo, Redo, Clear with Swipe for Delete |

In this activity, we created a profile screen form wherein we can update the text values of our profile section dynamically everytime the text is written. I added animations alongside it wherein when you submit and the input form is invalid, it will shake. Other than that, I made the profile picture editable by choosing a image found in the local storage of the emulator.
| Profile Screen Form |  Tested the input validation | Image Change | Profile Updated Successfully and changed profile data |
